# oot3dhax
This is a 3DS savedata exploit for "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D". Hence the datetime displayed for the save-slot, this haxx has existed since October 2012. The following regions are supported: USA, EUR, and JPN. Since the gamecard(there's only one "version" of the main CXI used for the gamecard) and eShop versions of the game are basically identical, the exploit can be used with both(if one can get the exploit savedata written to the save-image used by the target game version of course).  

This savegame haxx is the same one referred to here: http://3dbrew.org/wiki/5.0.0-11  

For details on the vuln/etc, see source and here: http://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_Userland_Flaws

### Haxx usage
1. Goto the save-slot select screen
2. Select haxx save-saveslot 
3. Begin loading the save-slot
4. Wait for the game to finish loading
5. Either press A, do anything triggering display of dialogs, or press any button on the touch-screen(the VIEW button, the MAP button, and the buttons for the currently equipped items don't trigger it).  

### Build methods
There's two build methods:
* Build the savefiles then write those to the savedata FS via other methods (recommended), such as ctrclient-yls8.
* Build the savefiles + generate a save with 3dsfuse then update the AESMAC (see Makefile, requires a tool for actually calculating the AESMAC).  

Make command: 
"make EXECHAX={value} FWVER={value}"
FWVER should be any value >=0x25 for system-version >=v5.0 with EXECHAX=2, value 0x1F otherwise.  
The following option can be added to the end of the above command, to disable calling dsp_shutdown(): "DISABLE_DSPSHUTDOWN=1" Normally this isn't needed. This option *must* *not* be used when this build would be used with a ninjhax2 payload.bin.

EXECHAX values(see also http://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DS_System_Flaws):
* 0 for arm9 pxips9hax(fixed with v5.0).
* 1 for arm11code-loading via reading the savefile with fsuser directly to .text(fixed with system-version v4.0).
* 2 for GSP arm11code-loading haxx.
* 3 for arm9hax with AM(fixed with v5.0).

The arm11-code uses gxcmd4 to load "/payload.bin" from the savedata FS to process-address 0x00101000 for execution, see source(filesize can be arbitrary).  
The arm9-code loads a payload from SD card, see source.  

For reading/writing the savefile(this can be any save0X.bin file) with ctrclient-yls8, for gamecard:
* Reading save00.bin: ctrclient-yls8 --serveradr={ipadr} "--customcmd=directfilerw 0x567890B1 0x1 0x1 0x4 0x18 0x1 0x0 2F007300610076006500300030002E00620069006E000000 @out.bin"
* Write save00.bin:   ctrclient-yls8 --serveradr={ipadr} "--customcmd=directfilerw 0x567890B1 0x1 0x1 0x4 0x18 0x7 0x14dc 0x0 2F007300610076006500300030002E00620069006E000000 @input.bin"
* Write payload.bin:  ctrclient-yls8 --serveradr={ipadr} "--customcmd=directfilerw 0x567890B1 0x1 0x1 0x4 0x1a 0x7 {payloadsize} 0x0 2F007000610079006C006F00610064002E00620069006E000000 @payload.bin"
* Read payload.bin:   ctrclient-yls8 --serveradr={ipadr} "--customcmd=directfilerw 0x567890B1 0x1 0x1 0x4 0x1a 0x1 0x0 2F007000610079006C006F00610064002E00620069006E000000 @out.bin"
